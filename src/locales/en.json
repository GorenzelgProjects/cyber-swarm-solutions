      "headline": "The Architecture",
      "description": "The core of ColleaiQ is a multi-agent system (MAS). We treat AI less like a magic box and more like a briefing room.\n\nFor any given task, we spin up a specific team of agents. In our security work, one agent might act as an attacker looking for a path, while another watches the logs to see if that path is visible. They share a memory and a context but have different instructions and learning paradigms.\n\nThis separation enforces logic, traceability, and security. When one agent has to explain its plan to another, it forces a level of reasoning that is hard to get from a single model."
    },
    "whereWeStart": {
      "headline": "Current Focus: Threat Simulation",
      "description": "Cybersecurity is our proving ground. The volume of new vulnerabilities (CVEs) and attack techniques makes it hard for human teams to test everything manually.\n\nWe are developing a platform that automates this testing in a safe way. Our agents act as a 'Red Team' inside a secure sandbox environment. They take a specific threat and try to execute it against a replica of a system. \n\nThis isn't about guessing. It's about rehearsal. The system produces a step-by-step narrative of what happened, showing exactly where a defense held up and where it didn't."
    },
    "whyStart": {
      "headline": "Why Start Here?",
      "description": "We chose security because it is difficult. The environment is adversarial and the requirement for precision is high. If an agent hallucinates here, it is immediately obvious.\n\nThis constraint is good for us. It forces us to build systems that are grounded in evidence. We focus heavily on 'explainability'—ensuring that every decision the system makes can be traced back to a specific piece of data or a specific rule. That discipline will be essential as we eventually move into other fields."

    "whatUnlock": {
      "headline": "Beyond Security",
      "description": "The patterns we are building for threat hunting apply elsewhere. Many industries rely on professionals who have to synthesize large amounts of information, check it against complex rules, and make a judgment call.\n\nWe are already exploring how these agent architectures translate to LegalTech and complex compliance work. The goal is always the same: to use agents to handle the complexity, so humans can make the final decision with better information."

We define a scope—usually a specific set of security scenarios or compliance checks—and we tune the agents to that environment. It helps us refine our coordination protocols, and it gives you a view into how autonomous agents handle your specific reality."

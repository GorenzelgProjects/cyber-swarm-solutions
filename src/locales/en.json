      "headline": "Where Artificial Intelligence meets collective intelligence",
      "paragraph1": "Most security tools sit on top of logs and infrastructure and wait for something to look wrong. They are great at flagging known patterns and policy violations, but they rarely explore how an attacker could actually move through your environment. Misconfigurations and weak paths can sit untouched for months, simply because nobody has walked them end-to-end.",
      "paragraph2": "ColleaiQ is a multi-agent AI system that continuously rehearses realistic attacks in a sandbox that mirrors your setup. Specialised agents coordinate to explore attack paths, collect evidence and propose concrete actions. A human analyst stays in the loop to review and refine the results, so automation handles the repetitive exploration while judgement, risk appetite and final decisions remain human.",

    "challenge": {
      "headline": "The Challenge",
      "paragraph1": "If you've lived in a SOC, you know the pattern: signatures, threat feeds, a quarterly pentest, and a SIEM that never sleeps. Useful—just late.",
      "paragraph2": "Exposures spread faster than patches. Regulators ask for proof, not vibes. And most alerts arrive without the context you need to act.",
      "paragraph3": "With headcount tight, we need proactive work that doesn't touch production and produces evidence you can take to an auditor or a board."

    "howItWorks": {
      "headline": "How ColleaiQ Works",
      "description": "Think of ColleaiQ as a digital blue team you supervise. Our agents explore realistic paths an attacker would try—inside a sandbox that mirrors your setup. We record what we attempted, what we saw and why it matters, then draft a practical fix. An analyst approves or edits the plan, and that decision teaches the system what to focus on next."
    },
    "whyTeams": {
      "headline": "Why teams work with us",
      "description": "Less noise, more signal. Each finding shows the attempt, the evidence, the impact, and the next step—no detective work required. It's easy to brief and easy to audit, which means fixes actually get done.",

Today you get: safe sandbox simulations; evidence-first reports with affected assets and a proposed fix; analyst-in-the-loop approval; and a clean audit trail built for EU workflows. We integrate and price through partners like itm8. We're not claiming autonomous red teaming."

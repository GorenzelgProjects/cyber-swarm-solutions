      "headline": "Where artificial intelligence rehearses real attacks",
      "paragraph1": "Most security tools watch logs and infrastructure and wait for something to look wrong. They are useful for alerts and policy violations, but they rarely explore how an attacker could actually move through your systems. Weak spots can stay invisible for a long time simply because nobody has walked the path end to end.",
      "paragraph2": "ColleaiQ is a small platform that helps you rehearse realistic attacks in a safe copy of your environment. We use a set of cooperating AI agents to map plausible paths, try them out in a sandbox and collect evidence. A human analyst reviews the results with you, so automation does the heavy lifting, while priorities and decisions stay human.",

    "challenge": {
      "headline": "The challenge",
      "paragraph1": "If you talk to people who work with security today, a few themes repeat themselves. There are more systems, more identities and more integrations than ever. Cloud services, operational technology, third-party providers and older infrastructure all end up on the same attack surface, but they are rarely tested as one connected whole.",
      "paragraph2": "Most teams rely on log platforms, endpoint protection and threat intelligence feeds. These tools are strong at telling you what just happened, or warning you about a known indicator of compromise. They are much less helpful when you want to answer a simple question:\n\n\"If someone really tried to get in here this month, where would they start, and what could they reach?\"",
      "paragraph3": "That kind of end-to-end rehearsal is usually reserved for manual red-team exercises a few times a year. On top of that, rules such as NIS2 expect documented risk management, testing activity and clear decision trails, while experienced security people are in short supply."

    "howItWorks": {
      "headline": "How ColleaiQ works in practice",
      "description": "ColleaiQ is built around one idea: security improves when you can safely test how things fail.\n\nIn pilots today, we work with you to create a sandbox that mirrors key parts of your environment. Our multi-agent system then helps with three steps:\n\n**Plan a realistic path.** We describe a plausible way an attacker could move, based on a newly published exposure or a scenario we agree together.\n\n**Rehearse it safely.** The agents walk that path inside the sandbox, never on live systems, and record what actually happens at each step.\n\n**Turn it into actions.** We generate a short, evidence-based finding: which systems were involved, what the impact was in the sandbox, and which changes would have blocked the path.\n\nA human analyst from our side reviews each result with you. Over time, these rehearsals build up a concrete picture of how exposures behave in your specific setup, not just in theory."
    },
    "whyTeams": {
      "headline": "Why teams try ColleaiQ",
      "description": "Teams use ColleaiQ because it takes on the slow discovery work and comes back with something concrete.\n\nIn the current alpha, ColleaiQ can:\n\n• track newly published vulnerabilities that are relevant for your technology stack\n\n• run rehearsals for selected exposures in a sandbox that mirrors your environment\n\n• produce short reports that link each rehearsal to affected assets and suggested changes\n\nEvery run is signed off by a human analyst. You get fewer \"maybe\" findings and more specific examples of \"here is what we tried in the sandbox, and here is how you could close this path in the real world\".",

    "whatYouGet": {
      "headline": "What you can use today",
      "description": "ColleaiQ is in alpha with pilot customers. Right now, you can expect:\n\n• Exposure-driven rehearsals for selected newly published vulnerabilities\n\n• Safe sandbox runs that never touch production systems\n\n• Evidence-first findings that show attempt → observation → suggested fix\n\n• Lightweight integrations with existing tools such as Velociraptor, endpoint protection and log platforms, plus export into your case or ticket system\n\nWe are still early. Some things require our hands-on help, and we only take on a small number of pilots at a time. The upside is that you can influence how the product grows."
    },
    "rehearsal": {
      "headline": "Safe rehearsal: exposure → sandbox → observations",
      "description": "When a relevant exposure appears, we work with you to decide whether it is worth rehearsing. If it is, ColleaiQ sets up a realistic path in the sandbox and runs it step by step.\n\nYou see what was attempted, what actually worked inside the sandbox, and where risk tends to concentrate in your environment under that scenario.",

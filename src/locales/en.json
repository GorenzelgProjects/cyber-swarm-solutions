      "headline": "Where artificial intelligence rehearses real attacks",
      "paragraph1": "Most security tools watch logs and infrastructure and wait for something to look wrong. They are useful for alerts and policy checks, yet they rarely explore how an attacker could actually move through your systems. Weak paths can stay invisible for a long time simply because nobody has walked them end to end.",
      "paragraph2": "ColleaiQ is built from the ground up as a multi-agent system for cybersecurity. A coordinated network of specialised AI agents work together: some read new exposures and understand how they relate to your setup, others plan and execute realistic attack paths in a safe sandbox, and others collect traces and turn them into a clear story. A human analyst reviews the results with you, so the agents handle the heavy exploration while risk appetite and final decisions stay human.",

    "challenge": {
      "headline": "The challenge",
      "paragraph1": "Talk to people who work with security today and a few themes repeat themselves. There are more systems, more identities and more integrations than ever. Cloud services, operational technology, third-party providers and older infrastructure all end up on the same attack surface, yet they are rarely tested as one connected whole.",
      "paragraph2": "Many teams rely on log platforms, endpoint protection and threat intelligence feeds. These tools are strong at telling you what just happened, or warning when a known indicator appears. They are much less helpful when you want to answer a simple question:\n\n\"If someone really tried to get in here this month, where would they start, and how far could they get?\"",
      "paragraph3": "That kind of end-to-end rehearsal is usually reserved for manual red-team exercises a few times a year. At the same time, rules such as NIS2 expect documented risk management, testing activity and clear decision trails, while experienced security people are in short supply."

    "howItWorks": {
      "headline": "How ColleaiQ works in practice",
      "description": "ColleaiQ is built around one idea: security improves when you can safely test how things fail.\n\nIn pilots today, we work with you to create a sandbox that mirrors key parts of your environment. Our multi-agent system then follows a simple rhythm:\n\n**1. Plan realistic paths**\nA group of reader and planner agents take a newly published exposure or a scenario we agree together and propose one or more plausible ways an attacker could move through your environment.\n\n**2. Rehearse them safely**\nOrchestration agents walk those paths step by step inside the sandbox, never on live systems, and record what actually happens at each stage: which actions succeed, which controls react and where the path stalls.\n\n**3. Turn it into actions**\nReporting agents assemble a short, evidence-based finding: which systems were involved, what the impact was in the sandbox, and which changes would have blocked the path.\n\nA human analyst from our side reviews each result with you. Over time, these rehearsals build up a concrete picture of how exposures behave in your specific setup instead of staying abstract."
    },
    "whyTeams": {
      "headline": "Why teams try ColleaiQ",
      "description": "Teams use ColleaiQ because multi-agent rehearsals take on the slow discovery work and come back with something concrete.\n\nIn the current alpha, ColleaiQ can:\n\n• track selected newly published vulnerabilities that are relevant for your technology stack\n\n• run rehearsals for agreed exposures in a sandbox that mirrors important parts of your environment\n\n• produce short reports that link each rehearsal to affected systems and suggested changes\n\nEvery run is signed off by a human analyst. You get fewer \"maybe\" findings and more specific examples such as: \"here is what we tried in the sandbox, here is how far it went under your current setup, and here is what would have stopped it.\"",

      "description": "ColleaiQ is in alpha with pilot customers. We prefer to be clear about what is ready now and what is still in progress.\n\nRight now, you can expect:\n\n• multi-agent, exposure-driven rehearsals for selected newly published vulnerabilities\n\n• safe sandbox runs that never touch production systems\n\n• evidence-first findings that show attempt → observation → suggested fix\n\n• lightweight integrations with existing tools such as Velociraptor, endpoint protection and log platforms, plus export into your case or ticket system\n\nWe are still early. Some things require our hands-on help, and we only take on a small number of pilots at a time. The upside is that you can influence how the product grows."

      "headline": "Safe rehearsal: exposure → sandbox → observations",
